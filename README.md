# mDCAAR
An auto attacker and raid joiner for Outwar.com

## About
The current programs out there are Windows only, so I figured I'd put one out there that's free (if you run it locally), opensource, and accessible from a web browser.

## Install
`git clone git@github.com:bartholomew91/outwar-auto-attacker-raider.git`

## Running
You'll need to run to seperate servers for the program to work. So run each of these lines from a different terminal. Make sure you're in the root of the codes directory.

### Server
`cd server && npm run server:start`

### Client
When this is run, it should open in your browser, if it does not you can access the application by going to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

`cd client && yarn start`
